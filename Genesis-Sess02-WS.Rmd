\texttt{\vn{3} And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 
\vn{4} And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light 
from the darkness. \vn{5} God called the light Day, and the darkness He 
called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first 
day. \vn{6} And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the 
waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." \vn{7} And 
God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse 
from the waters that were over the expanse. And it was so. \vn{8} And 
God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, 
the second day. \vn{9} And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens 
be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And 
it was so. \vn{10} God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that 
were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 
\vn{11} And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding 
seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according 
to its kind, on the earth." And it was so. \vn{12} The earth brought forth 
vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees 
bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And 
God saw that it was good. \vn{13} And there was evening and there was 
morning, the third day. \vn{14} And God said, "Let there be lights in the 
expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them 
be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, \vn{15} and let them 
be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And 
it was so. \vn{16} And God made the two great lights -- the greater light 
to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night -- and the stars. 
\vn{17} And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on 
the earth, \vn{18} to rule over the day and over the night, and to 
separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
\vn{19} And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.  (ESV)}

# Suggestions for Exploration

1. As we did last time, please refer to John 1:1-5 as you consider 
this passage, particularly in regard to what John says about "light". 
Do you think John is purposely alluding to the beginning of Genesis? 
If so, why do you think he is doing this?

2. Summarize the storyline of the Bible in one sentence. (Does it change your
answer at all if you take the scope of the story to be eternity rather than
Genesis to Revelation?)

\vspace{0.5 in}

3. As God moves history forward from the formless emptiness of Gen 1:1-2, 
the first thing He creates is "light".  And yet, what \emph{we} think of 
as light is not created until the fourth day.  What do you make of this? 
What other comparisons can you make between verses 3-5 and verses 14-19?

\vspace{0.5 in}

4. A significant theme throughout the Bible is the conflict between the 
seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. We haven't gotten to that 
in Genesis yet, but the same Hebrew word for "seed" is used four times 
in verses 9-13.^[Very generally, in the Bible, when a word is repeated 
more than seems necessary, it is \emph{possible} the author is trying to 
get our attention.] What ideas do you have about why God might be making 
such a big deal about \emph{seed}?

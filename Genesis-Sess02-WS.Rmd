\texttt{\vn{3} And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. 
\vn{4} And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light 
from the darkness. \vn{5} God called the light Day, and the darkness He 
called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first 
day. \vn{6} And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the 
waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." \vn{7} And 
God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse 
from the waters that were over the expanse. And it was so. \vn{8} And 
God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, 
the second day. \vn{9} And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens 
be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And 
it was so. \vn{10} God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that 
were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 
\vn{11} And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding 
seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according 
to its kind, on the earth." And it was so. \vn{12} The earth brought forth 
vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees 
bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And 
God saw that it was good. \vn{13} And there was evening and there was 
morning, the third day. \vn{14} And God said, "Let there be lights in the 
expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them 
be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, \vn{15} and let them 
be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And 
it was so. \vn{16} And God made the two great lights -- the greater light 
to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night -- and the stars. 
\vn{17} And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on 
the earth, \vn{18} to rule over the day and over the night, and to 
separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 
\vn{19} And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.  (ESV)}

# Suggestions for Exploration

1. What observations do you think you might be able to make if it was 
a good day and not just an average day?  I mean, a \emph{really} good 
day, like the best day you ever could dream of having?^[The hyperbole 
here is truly justified, trust me.]

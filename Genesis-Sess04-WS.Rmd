\texttt{\vn{1} Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all 
the host of them. \vn{2} And on the seventh day God finished his work 
that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work 
that he had done. \vn{3} So God blessed the seventh day and made it 
holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in 
creation.   (ESV)}

# Suggestions for Exploration

\large{}

1. There is plenty to ponder concerning how this passage relates to 
"the Sabbath".  \emph{However,} before letting yourself go there, try to 
examine this passage apart from all that, and just make as many 
objective observations as you can.  What do you see?

\vspace{0.5 in}

2. It seems pretty safe to say that God never gets tired, so what do you 
think it means in this passage when it says that God "rested"?  What might 
He have been doing during this period of resting?

\vspace{0.5 in}

3. Verse 3 says that God "blessed" the seventh day and "made it holy".  What 
do these words and phrases mean?

\vspace{0.5 in}

4. Try to find a passage in the OT that links our passage this week to 
the Jewish Sabbath, and explain the logic of the connection.

\vspace{0.5 in}

5. Consider (if you haven't already) Exodus 31:13 and Deuteronomy 5:15.  What 
do these passages add to your understanding of what God wants the Sabbath to 
mean to His people?  And then, what does Isaiah 58:13-14 add to the picture?

6. Please describe/explain some of Jesus' teaching about the Sabbath.

\vspace{0.5 in}

7. Based on all the above, how would describe a gospel-based view of the 
Sabbath?

\vspace{0.5 in}

8. What support can you find in the Bible for changing the Sabbath from the 
seventh day of the week to the first day of the week?

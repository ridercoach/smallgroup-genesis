\texttt{\vn{1} Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all 
the host of them. \vn{2} And on the seventh day God finished his work 
that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work 
that he had done. \vn{3} So God blessed the seventh day and made it 
holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in 
creation.   (ESV)}

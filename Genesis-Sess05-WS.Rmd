\texttt{\vn{4} These are the generations of the heavens and the earth 
when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and 
the heavens. \vn{5} When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no 
small plant of the field had yet spring up --- for the LORD God had not 
caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, 
\vn{6} and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole 
face of the ground --- \vn{7} then the LORD God formed the man of dust 
from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and 
the man became a living creature. \vn{8} And the LORD God planted a garden 
in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. \vn{9} 
And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is 
pleasant to the sight and good for food.  The tree of life was in the 
midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \vn{10} 
A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and 
became four rivers. \vn{11} The name of the first is the Pishon.  It is the 
one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
\vn{12} And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are 
there. \vn{13} The name of the second river is the Gihon.  It is the one 
that flowed around the whole land of Cush. \vn{14} And the name of the 
third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria.  And the fourth 
river is the Euphrates. \vn{15} The LORD God took the man and put him in 
the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. \vn{16} And the LORD God commanded 
the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, \vn{17} but 
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the 
day that you eat of it you shall surely die."   (ESV)}
